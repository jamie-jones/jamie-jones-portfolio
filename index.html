                    Jamie Jones is new to web development, beginning her career
                    as a student in an online Bootcamp for web development.
                    Before this, she was in the Army for a couple of years until
                    she was medically discharged and returned home to Georgia.
                    For a year, she worked at an animal hospital as a veterinary
                    technician and kennel technician with the intention of
                    getting experience before going to school to become a
                    veterinarian. It wasn't long before she realized her true
                    desire in life is to travel the world, and from a friend,
                    she heard about web development, which would give her
                    possibility while she still worked. After research, she
                    decided this was something she would find enjoyable, and she
                    quickly signed up for a three month web development course.

                    Jamie is an animal lover and adopted a three week old
                    kitten, now named Ellie, while working at the animal
                    hospital. She also has a 12 year old dog named Chanel. She
                    loves horror movies and listening to Kpop as well as playing
                    video games like and reading.
