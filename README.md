# Jamie Jones' Portfolio

## Description

This, as you can see, is a website for my Web Development portfolio! My very own website about myself where I can be my best Leo self! Rawr! As you can see, this site contains three pages: Contact, Portfolio, and About Me. The Contact contains a form in which you enter your name, your email, and a message for me to receive; though I currently will not receive such things as there is nothing connected to the submit button as of now. The Portfolio page consists of multiple photos. Finally, we have the About Me page. This page has a photo of me along with two paragraphs about me. The first paragraph talks about my previous employment and my journey into finding my way to Web Development. The second paragraph is a short one about my hobbies and interests and my fur babies.

For each of the pages, we start off with the Navbar, which holds my name and the link to the three pages. My name is clickable, and if clicked, it will send you to the About Me page. Whatever page you are on, you will notice that it shows up in darker font than the others to let you know which page you are on, in case you forgot. If you are on a tablet or a phone, the page will adjust to the size and the Navbar will have a dropdown for the links instead of displaying them all together. This is for easier reading and clicking, and simply looks much more attractive overall. At the bottom of the pages is a sticky footer, which frankly was the hardest thing for me to code into the pages. But it finally happened and I am happy!

## Features

As you make the window smaller and smaller, you will notice that the pages follow along and adjust to the shrinking. On the Portfolio page, once it's been shrunk down a phone layout, you'll see that the photos stack below each other, showing only one photo per row. In the About me page, you'll see that the paragraph stacks below the photo as well. This was created using Bootstrap coding, so there is a link to the Bootstrap CCS style sheet as well as Bootstrap Javascript, which was needed for the navbar dropdown system.
